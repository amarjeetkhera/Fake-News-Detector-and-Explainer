Language step game tend rise send.\",\n          \"One of Donald Trump s advisors thought he was going on CNN to smear Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton, but instead he was embarrassed on national television for spewing more of Trump s lies.On Friday afternoon, Trump had spoken at an event for the National Rifle Association, where he attacked Clinton s positions on guns so that the right-wing organization would endorse him. Later that day, Trump advisor Stephen Miller echoed Trump s words on CNN, only to be met with hysterical laughter.Host Don Lemon brought up Trump s pandering NRA speech and called the presumptive Republican nominee out for telling lies about Clinton wanting to get rid of the 2nd Amendment. Lemon said: I want to talk about the 2nd Amendment. Because Donald Trump continues to say that Hillary Clinton wants to abolish the 2nd Amendment. That is false. That is false by every fact-checker, by the campaign, by her, by everyone who is listening but Donald Trump. Why does he continue to say that? Miller could barely finish  Because it s true  before the entire panel   Lemon included   erupted into laughter at the ridiculous statement. Once the laughter had died down, Miller continued to claim that Clinton wanted to overturn the Supreme Court s District of Columbia v. Heller decision that shot down a law that made carrying an unregistered gun illegal, and prohibited the registration of handguns while other weapons were allowed.Miller said that if this decision was overturned, the 2nd Amendment would no longer exist. Guest Sally Kohn jumped in and countered that there had been restrictions on guns long before the Heller decision, and that even Constitutional originalist Antonin Scalia believed that guns should have some restrictions and regulations.You can watch Trump s advisor humiliate himself in the video below:Trump says Clinton wants to end the 2nd amendment, despite PolitiFact rating the claim false. @donlemon has more. https://t.co/GVpoTVIzY8  CNN Tonight (@CNNTonight) May 21, 2016Featured image via screen capture\",\n          \"Obama is against Trump  Check The Media are against Trump  Check The establishment Democrats are against Trump  Check The establishment Republicans are against Trump  CheckThe UN is against Trump  Check The EU is against Trump  Check China is against Trump  Check Mexico is against Trump Soros is against Trump  Check Black Lives Matter is against Trump  Check Move On is against Trump  Check Koch Brothers are against Trump  Check Bushes are against Trump   CheckPlanned Parenthood is against Trump .Check Hillary & Sanders are both against Trump   Check Illegal aliens are against Trump   Check Islam is against Trump   Check Kasich & Cruz are against Trump   Check Hateful, racist, violent Liberals are against Trump..
