# üé¨ Fake News Detector and Explainer

## üìÑ Project Overview

This project focuses on building a Fake News Detector model to classify fake and real news. In today's globally connected world, social media plays an important role in everyday life. It is no longer a luxury but rather a necessity without which it is hard to imagine the existence of the modern world. However, this interconnectedness also facilitates the rapid spread of misinformation, making it crucial to develop tools that can identify and mitigate the impact of fake news. This project aims to address this challenge by creating a robust fake news detection system that not only classifies news articles but also provides explanations for its predictions.

## üìÇ Description

The dataset used in this project combines real news articles sourced from reputable APIs and datasets with synthetically generated fake news. The fake news was created using a combination of the `faker` library, which produces realistic-sounding but fictional data, and the powerful Mistral API, which generates coherent and contextually relevant text. This approach ensures a diverse and challenging dataset that mirrors the complexities of real-world fake news.

### Dataset Summary

-   Total Articles: [Specify the total number of articles in your dataset]
-   Labels: Binary (real or fake news)
-   Data Split: [Specify the training, validation, and testing split ratios]
-   Article Format: Text data containing news content.
-   Sentiment Labels:
    -   1 (fake news)
    -   0 (real news)

### Column Information

-   `text`: The text content of the news article.
-   `label`: The authenticity label, where 1 indicates fake news and 0 indicates real news.

### Data Augmentation

To enhance the model's performance and address class imbalance, we implemented data augmentation techniques:

-   Synthetic fake news generation using `faker` and the Mistral API.
-   [Mention any other augmentation techniques used, e.g., back-translation, synonym replacement]

## üöÄ Objectives

-   Develop a high-accuracy model to distinguish between real and fake news articles.
-   Integrate the Mistral API to generate human-readable explanations for the model's predictions, enhancing transparency and user trust.
-   Implement an active learning mechanism that leverages the LLM's explanations to refine the model's accuracy.
-   Deploy the model as a user-friendly web application, making it accessible to a wide audience.
